# mtgox-bot

Bot trading against MtGox

## Usage

First, launch the server
```bash
$ node index.js
```

## Progress

This is a work in progress. 
Right now it only works against
[mtgox-mock](http://github.com/czzarr/mtgox-mock) in a local
environment.
In order to make it work on MtGox not much is needed.
See the `TODO.md` for the next steps.
